# 👋 Hi there, I'm Mario!

🎓 I'm currently finishing the 4th year of my **Health Engineering degree** at the **University of Burgos (Spain)**.

🧪 I completed a hospital internship at the **Nuclear Medicine Department** of the University Hospital of Burgos (HUBU).

📁 For my Bachelor's Thesis, I developed a clinical software tool for the **Intensive Care Unit (ICU)** at HUBU.
